                    Semantic markup is defined as a way of writing and structuring HTML code in order to clearly communicate the structure and meaning of content on a webpage or site, confirms the web source <a href="https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/#:~:text=Semantic%20markup%20is%20a%20way,content%20rather%20than%20its%20appearance.">(Brevity, 2017)</a>. Before we can think of the content’s appearance, which may come first to mind when thinking of this definition, semantic markup rather, pays close attention to the context’s structure in the way HTML code is implemented to distinguish between different types of information. With the aid of <strong>HTML tags</strong>, which offer affordances for the separation or grouping of similar and different content, it should be much more efficient for not only developers, but users and computer machines to read and identify information displayed on a web page or site, not forgetting its hierarchy of importance as well. In this instance, the choice of tags would communicate the importance and structure of content rather than its appearance on the web. <a href="https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/#:~:text=Semantic%20markup%20is%20a%20way,content%20rather%20than%20its%20appearance.">(Brevity, 2017)</a>.

                    It is also important for web developers to ensure that their site is compatible for both humans and computer machines to read, proclaims the source. Implementing semantic markup and use of semantic tags, allows developers to gather their most important information higher up the hierarchy on their site’s structure. This allows search engines to identify what the information is about, ranking it on its relevance to similar searches of the content on the web. This is referred to as <a href="https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/#:~:text=Semantic%20markup%20is%20a%20way,content%20rather%20than%20its%20appearance.">“SEO”</a> in web design, one of the reasons why it is essential for computer machines to read a developer’s site. Accessibility is another term to closely configure in relation to semantic markup. <a href="https://medium.com/codex/what-is-semantic-markup-and-why-you-should-use-it-44777543c29c">(Siriwardana, 2021)</a> proves that the correct use of navigation and sidebar tags for example, accommodates even users with different disability needs to customize their experience one a developer’s site. Lastly, maintenance is another key factor to consider in the importance of implementing semantic markup. Time-saving stands as the common factor in this instance, where it is easier to work with logically organized code in the long-run whether for editing or duplication purposes and therefore maintenance is achieved, according to <a href="https://medium.com/codex/what-is-semantic-markup-and-why-you-should-use-it-44777543c29c">(Siriwardana, 2021)</a>.
