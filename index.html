                    “They say everything is designed to perfection by the divine. Drawing back to how the Creator carved us all in his image, to help us understand what it really means to be human, to be born with a purpose to create. The Cartierverse is a step into a world that you should wish to create for yourself. Not one that family or peers want for you, but the one you truly desire - the one you were born to create. One where you’re your outmost genuine and in complete harmony with self. 
                    It’s a higher manifestation that’s put to practice as you begin to operate on this powerful, pure frequency that’s in alignment with your purpose, your reason for being. We ought to look deep inside of ourselves & get to know who we really are, why we are & start carving the life we truly desire, for it’s the Creator’s calling for every one of us. You’re you for a reason, a born creator & if you can imagine something, you can create it. It’s already yours."
