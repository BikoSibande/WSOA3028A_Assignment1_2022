                    This section will draw a close study on <strong>Hyperlink</strong> as an example of <strong>Hypertext</strong> to reflect the relationship between structure and navigation. Hyperlink, as hypertext, reflects a very complex phenomenon in the way that they cannot be solely defined or have a fixed meaning. A number of historical and present practices have varying influences in the way one could begin to define what hyperlinks are. A major point of analysis that <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/34216/files?preview=2738945">(Halavais, 2008)</a> points out in the definition of a hyperlink, in the text -The Hyperlink as Organising Principle, is the relation imposed between the hyperlink and its use. In the basis of this comparison, we could then start to identify what they are, by closely analysing how they work and their effect on information gathering, structuring and as well as what role they play in and outside of the information social space. In the most basic sense, <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/34216/files?preview=2738945">(Halavais, 2008)</a> highlights the idea of a hyperlink as “a reference that automatically brings a user to a particular point in a cited work”. However, there is more to hyperlinks than just retrieving electronic documents from different web servers. He argues that hyperlinks work to reflect and organize deep social and cultural structures at a conscious and unconscious level, but how? With the complexity and growth of the printing press, together with the different mediums used to display and share digital texts, hyperlinks have worked to allow different and multiple users access to a wide network of texts with similar ideas or points of interests. In this way, they have sort of grouped similar texts, authors and web browsers with similar points of interest, and with the help of fast-advancing digital enterprises like Google, the tracking and collection of such information can create separate identities amongst societies with different or even similar practices and points of interests and therefore indirectly shaping society structures.                </p>

                    Hyperlinks also serve as an extension to historical and modern research practices. As a complex phenomenon which Halavais reflects to as a continuous process of <strong>“cumulative innovation”</strong>, hyperlinks also work to broaden their own meaning, function and power in both the digital and real world. Historically, pre-developed citations and referencing techniques to texts were more static and required ampul time to navigate to and from. However, with major developments of digital texts together with advanced mediums that continue to enhance the vast development of hyperlinks and their uses, hyperlinks serve as an extension to scholarly research to begin with. Through the efficiency in the navigation of acquiring information from multiple sources, modern researchers are easily able to source, analyze, criticize and compare ancient ideologies found in traditional texts compromising of different contexts and times. In this way, hyper-conversations and relationships arise in the form of new research techniques to further develop and shape social knowledge. The continuous expansion of digital mediums and texts also means the expansion of hyperlink forms and uses. Outside of just scholarly research, hyperlinks now meet advanced navigation forms, where one could use a hyperlink to change the camera projections on a “Google Maps” for example. This goes on to reflect on how hyperlinks cannot have a fixed definition as they continue to develop vastly with their uses and thus continue to be an extension of themselves as well. With this dynamic influence on information structures, it is no doubt how social structures are continuously shaped by the collaborative knowledge of ideologies that hyperlinks allow between all kinds of researchers, texts and their contexts.
