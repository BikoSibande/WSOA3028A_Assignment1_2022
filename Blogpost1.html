                    <strong>Hypertext </strong>is one subject that tends to be quite complex when trying to decode its most accurate definition. Its complexities rise from the early ages, where <strong>Theodor  Holm  (“Ted”)  Nelson</strong> gave its first definition, concluding that hypertext represented forms of hypermedia that operate textually. However, this definition is in contrast to many similar definitions that form more or less of a trend in the literary community, as stated by <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/34216/files?preview=2738922">(Wardrip-Fruin, 2004)</a> He points out a few hypertext researchers that choose to centre their definitions around the link concept. He reflects on Marie-Laure Ryan’s view, stating that readers unfold texts by clicking on hyperlinks, which introduce other parts of text. Furthermore, Espen  Aarseth, another hypertext researcher, is reflected to offer a similar definition of his own, that hypertext is simply a direct transition from one position in text to another’. In the same text, (Wardrip-Fruin) points out that many researchers oppose the link-based definitions, arguing that they lack some of the key components of hypertext, more importantly as the interaction with  information  to  build  associations,  and build knowledge through associations. Clearly hypertext seems to be quite a dynamic concept ranging from numerous past to present viewpoints, but how best could we best decode what hypertext is?

                    <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/34216/files?preview=2738922">(Wardrip-Fruin, 2004)</a> proclaims that given the complexities that accompany this concept, it best to understand hypertext from its initial inventor or thinker’s perspective, relying on its indigenous definition from its main and initial orchestrator. In this case, Theodor  Holm  (“Ted”)  Nelson was the man to do so, defining this concept as a body of written or pictorial work interlinked in such a way that it cannot simply be presented on paper. This was an extension to hypertext as only written text, since Nelson’s<a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/34216/files?preview=2738922">ELF file structure</a>  was discovered to give rise to even more complex and significant new media, where this definition invites hyperfilm. The term ‘new media’ would then invite link-based hypertext definitions as they arise as a form of new media and therefore defying the act of only seeking a solid definition form a historical point of view alone. (Wardrip-Fruin) goes on to highlight more extensions to hypertext, introducing hyper-media as systems of prearranged words and pictures, which only goes to show how far we might be form finding the best definition of hypertext.

                    This brings us to a rather, more relatable definition of hypertext. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/hypertext">(Stigliano, 2003)</a>’s web article on end-user computing tools, reflects on hypertext as a system that invites multiple user engagement through linked text documents. Hyperlinks are a typical figure, where ‘hyperlinked’ words then act as a portal to alternative information related to that word in the same or different document. These links are essential to modern computing as they provide easier navigation between text documents, a faster way to research additional content and a great way for theorists and researchers to share and compare information in multiple text documents.
